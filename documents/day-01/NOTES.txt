docker container run --detach --rm --name app1 --publish 80:80 khozemanullwala/python-flask-app:latest

docker container run --detach --rm --name app2 --publish 8888:80 khozemanullwala/python-flask-app:latest

docker container run --detach --rm --name app3 --publish 9999:80 khozemanullwala/python-flask-app:latest

docker container ls

docker ps


docker container stop app1
